#0x01. Git
My second readme in the 0x01-git directory
##0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
##1. Repo-session
##2. Coding fury road
- For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!
- Inside 0x01-git:

###Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
####Create these empty files:
- c/c_is_fun.c
- js/main.js
- js/index.js
- Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
- Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
- Add all these new files to git
- Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server
##3. Collaboration is the base of a company
##4. Collaboration: be up to date
##5. HAAA what did you do???
##6. Never push too much
